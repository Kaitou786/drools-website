I'm thrilled to share with the whole Drools & jBPM community that once again a student has being accepted in the Google Summer Of Code Program to work in the projects for the Summer. This year Google will be funding  Nicolas Gomes (from Argentina) to work on the jBPM project. Nicolas task will be to work towards the integration of the KIE Workbench with a Content Management System such as Magnolia.
